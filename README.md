**Insurance Charges Prediction**:
Predicting Medical Costs with Machine Learning (Linear Regression)
Turning raw healthcare data into a pricing compass for smarter insurance decisions.

**Project Overview**:
Insurance pricing is a delicate balancing act between risk and fairness. In this project, 
we build a Linear Regression model to predict individual medical insurance charges based on demographic, lifestyle, and other medical history data.

**Goal**: Estimate healthcare costs accurately using data-driven insights.

**Dataset Summary**
📦 Records: 1,338 individuals.
🧾 Features: 13 variables.
🎯 Target Variable: charges.

| `NUmber_of_past_hospitalizations` | Past hospital visits               |
| `Anual_Salary`                    | Income level                       |
| `region`                          | Residential region                 |
| `charges`                         | 💰 Insurance cost (Target)         |

**Approach**:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
Cleaned and validated dataset
Encoded categorical variables (sex, smoker, region)
Checked for missing values and inconsistencies

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
Distribution analysis of charges
Outlier detection (BMI, salary, charges)
Key insight: Smokers incur significantly higher charges

**3. Model Building**

We use a classic algorithm: 

**Linear Regression**: charges=β0​+β1​X1​+β2​X2​+...+βn​X
